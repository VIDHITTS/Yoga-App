    "info": "Yoga is an invaluable gift from India's ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body, thought and action, restraint and fulfillment, harmony between man and nature, and a holistic approach to health and well-being. Yoga is not about exercise but about discovering the sense of oneness with yourself, the world, and nature. The practice leads to the union of individual consciousness with universal consciousness, indicating a perfect harmony between the mind and body. The word 'Yoga' is derived from the Sanskrit root 'Yuj', meaning 'to join' or 'to yoke' or 'to unite'. The practice of Yoga leads to the union of individual consciousness with that of the Universal Consciousness.",

Most people use only a fraction of their lung capacity. Yogic breathing techniques teach full, deep breaths that utilize the entire lung capacity, improving oxygenation of blood and tissues. Coordinating breath with movement enhances the benefits of asanas and creates a meditative quality in practice.",

    "page": "42-44",
    "info": "Shavasana is the final relaxation pose, considered one of the most important in yoga. Lie on back with legs extended, feet falling naturally to sides. Arms rest alongside body, palms facing up, about 15 degrees away from torso. Adjust body so spine is aligned and symmetrical. Let feet flop open. Close eyes gently. Soften facial muscles, especially around eyes, jaw, and forehead. Breathe naturally without controlling breath. Consciously relax each body part: feet, legs, hips, abdomen, chest, hands, arms, shoulders, neck, face, and head. Release into floor's support. Let go of all effort and 'doing.' Remain for 5-15 minutes. To exit, deepen breath, gently wiggle fingers and toes, stretch arms overhead, roll to right side, and slowly sit up. Benefits: Reduces blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate, activates parasympathetic nervous system, deeply relaxes muscles and releases tension, reduces anxiety, stress, headaches, and fatigue, improves concentration and mental clarity, promotes quality sleep, allows integration of practice benefits. Despite appearing simple, Shavasana is challenging because of the mind's resistance to complete stillness. It teaches the art of conscious relaxation.",
